## ❌ Paid Options (For Comparison)

### Replicate API

**NOT FREE** - Costs:

- `lucataco/sadtalker`: ~$0.096 per run (10 runs per $1)
- `cjwbw/sadtalker`: ~$0.16 per run (6 runs per $1)

**Why mention it:**

- Only option that provides an API for integration
- Can be called from your Next.js app
- ~118 seconds processing time on A100 GPU

**Example API call:**

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Token ${process.env.REPLICATE_API_TOKEN}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({

## ⚠️ Important Limitation for Real-Time Conversations

**SadTalker is NOT suitable for real-time conversations**

**Latency:**

- ~118 seconds on A100 GPU (Replicate)
- ~2-5 minutes on free services
- Too slow for conversational AI

**Your Current System:**

```
User speaks → AI responds → Audio ready
                              ↓
                    Need lip-sync video FAST
```

**With SadTalker:**

```
User speaks → AI responds → Audio ready
                              ↓
                      SadTalker processes
                      (2-5 minutes wait) ❌
                              ↓
                      Video ready (too late!)
```

**Recommendation:**

- ✅ **For testing quality:** Use Hugging Face Spaces (free)
- ✅ **For real-time conversation:** Use LivePortrait or MuseTalk (1-3 sec
  latency)
- ❌ **Don't use SadTalker for real-time:** Too slow (2+ minutes)

---

## Testing Recommendation

**Step 1: Test SadTalker Quality (FREE)**

1. Go to: https://huggingface.co/spaces/vinthony/SadTalker
2. Upload a portrait photo of your avatar
3. Upload a sample audio from ElevenLabs
4. Generate video
5. Evaluate quality

**Step 2: Compare with Your Current System**

- Is SadTalker quality better than your SVG viseme animation?
- Is the quality improvement worth 2-5 minute wait?

**Step 3: Decision**

- If quality is amazing but too slow → Consider LivePortrait (1-3 sec)
- If quality is not much better → Stick with SVG (instant)
- If need production quality → Consider D-ID streaming (~100ms)

## Recommendation for FE-Engine-v2

**For testing purposes:** Use **Hugging Face Spaces** (free) to test quality,
then decide if you want to pursue real-time alternatives.

**For production:**

- ❌ Don't use SadTalker (too slow for real-time)
